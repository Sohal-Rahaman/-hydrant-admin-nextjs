# üî• Firebase Environment Variables - Why They're Public

## Why Firebase Config is Public
Firebase client-side configuration is **DESIGNED** to be public:

1. **Firebase SDK Requirement**: Client browsers need these values to connect
2. **Not Actually Secret**: These values are visible in browser network requests anyway
3. **Security by Rules**: Firebase security comes from Firestore rules, not hiding config
4. **Google's Design**: This is how Firebase web apps are meant to work

## Your Current Firebase Config
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

**These are NOT secrets** - they're configuration values that browsers need to access Firebase.
