## üé® **Alternative: Static Export for GitHub Pages**

If you want completely free hosting, we can convert to static:

```javascript
// next.config.js modification for static export
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: { unoptimized: true },
  // ... existing config
}
```

## üìù **Deployment Commands Added**

I've added these scripts to your `package.json`:
- `npm run export` - Create static export
- `npm run deploy:github` - Deploy to GitHub Pages
- `npm run deploy:surge` - Deploy to Surge.sh

## üéØ **My Recommendation**

**Start with Railway** because:
- Your app uses Firebase real-time features
- Admin authentication needs server-side support
- Railway's free tier is generous
- Easy to upgrade if needed
- Professional deployment experience
